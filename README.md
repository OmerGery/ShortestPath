# ShortestPath
A C++ Program that implents classic Shortest-path finding algorithms : Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman-Ford. The algorithms are implented using adjacency list , adjacency matrix. The program reads the "graphs" from a input file , and writes the time each one of them took into an output file.
